# Project Overview

This project is a front-end web layout clone of the Amazon India homepage. It was created using HTML and CSS, focusing on recreating the visual structure, navigation bar, product showcase sections, and footer elements similar to the original website. The project emphasizes responsive design practices, clean layout structuring, and an organized approach to styling with CSS.

# Project Description

The Amazon Clone Front-End Project replicates the user interface of the Amazon India website, providing users with a familiar online shopping layout experience. It includes:

A responsive top navigation bar with a logo, location display, search bar, and cart icon.

A dynamic hero section with a promotional banner.

Multiple product category sections displayed using flexbox for a neat grid arrangement.

A structured footer section with various informational links and branding.

This project does not include backend functionality or real-time product data â€” it is purely a static front-end demonstration to practice CSS layout techniques and UI cloning.

# Objectives

To practice and implement advanced HTML and CSS styling techniques.

To improve proficiency in Flexbox and responsive layout management.

To demonstrate an understanding of component-based styling using organized CSS classes.
